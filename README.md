# Hi, I'm Hammad 👋  

🎓 Aspiring AI researcher | Focused on Biomedical Machine Learning & Computer Vision  

I am a Computer Science graduate passionate about applying AI to healthcare challenges.  
My motivation comes from personal experience with a misdiagnosed skin condition, which taught me how critical accurate and accessible diagnostics are. Since then, I’ve been committed to using machine learning to improve clinical decision support systems.
